# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
 - A `conditional` is useful when you want to write an `if/else` variable to see whether a condition is met in your code.

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I would ask for more assistance and manage my time better so that I wouldn't miss study hall! I would also pay more attention to syntax so that there was less time wasted to easy-to-overlook errors.

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- The **productive struggle** was ever-present today. My thinking was trying to get into the lane of memorizing proper syntax and commands.  The learning was tough, yet rewarding.  The final product of troubleshooting my code and seeing satisfactory output was immensely satisfying.
